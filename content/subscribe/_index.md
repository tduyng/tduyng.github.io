# Subscribe to my RSS feed

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) lets you follow your favorite websites without checking them manually.

**How to subscribe:**

1. **Choose an RSS reader** – Find options at [aboutfeeds.com](https://aboutfeeds.com/) or [this guide](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/). I use [NetNewsWire](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire) on macOS/iOS (free and open-source).

2. **Add my feed** – Copy [this RSS link](/atom.xml) into your reader app.

That's it! You'll get all new posts automatically.

I provide [full-text RSS feeds](/blog/full-text-rss-feeds), so you can read complete articles in your reader without visiting the site.

Here's how my blog looks on NetNewsWire will full text RSS feed:

Happy reading and stay informed! 👋👋
