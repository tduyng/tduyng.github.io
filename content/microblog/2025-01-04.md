**CLI tools I love using**

I’m a huge fan of Rust, and it’s no surprise that many of the tools I rely on in the terminal are written in rust.

Here’s a quick rundown of my favorites:

- `fzf`: Fuzzy finder that makes searching files or commands a breeze.
- `eza`: A modern, colorful alternative to `ls` that adds more functionality.
- `zoxide`: A smarter `cd` command that remembers your most-used directories.
- `Fish shell`: A user-friendly shell with auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting.
- `Starship prompt`: Fast, customizable prompt with support for all major shells.
- `ripgrep`: Lightning-fast search tool, a must-have for large codebases.
- `sd`: Simpler, more intuitive replacement for `sed`.
- `fd`: Faster, friendlier alternative to `find` with colorful output.
- `jq`: Power tool for processing JSON data in the terminal.
- `lazygit`: Terminal-based Git interface, perfect for lazy devs.
- `lazydocker`: Easy-to-use terminal tool for managing Docker containers.
- `bat`: Better `cat` with syntax highlighting and line numbers.
- `git-delta`: Enhanced git diff tool with better formatting.
- `fnm`: Fast, Rust-based Node.js version manager.
