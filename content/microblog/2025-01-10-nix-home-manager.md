# First attempt at migrating from Homebrew to Nix with Nix Home Manager

It didnâ€™t go exactly as planned. I dived into Nix scripts, flakes, and started installing packages with nixpkgs while keeping Homebrew on the side.
But... nothing seemed to work correctly. ðŸ˜µ

Tools like `fish` shell, `fzf`, and `ghostty` .etc... didn't work.
I probably need to configure each program properly, manage environments, and link the `~/.config` files with Nix...

During the migration, I enabled autoCleanUp Homebrew with "zap" without paying close attention. Big mistake! It wiped out everything Iâ€™d installed through Homebrew. ðŸ˜± Aie aie aie.

Thankfully, I had saved all my tools in a Brewfile in my dotfiles. A quick `brew bundle` restored everything (though it took time to install).

Lesson learned: I need to take it step by step with Nix, learning more about proper configurations before jumping in too deep.

For now, Iâ€™m sticking with Homebrew but Iâ€™ll give Nix another try someday.
