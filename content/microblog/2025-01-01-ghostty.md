# Ghostty?

Ghostty has just released its official production-ready version: 1.0, and it’s causing quite a hype among developers across all platforms. I’m really curious to try it out!

Ghostty is a terminal emulator built with Zig. Most terminal emulators I’ve used, like WezTerm, Warp, Alacritty, and Zellij, are written in Rust. So it’s exciting to see a terminal tool developed in Zig instead.
(I really like both of 2 this languages: rust and zig)

I decided to give it a shot, even though I’ve been happily using WezTerm. And I have to say, I’m impressed.

It’s fast—faster than WezTerm in terms of startup time and when opening new tabs. It integrates smoothly with Fish shell, which I love.

The keybindings are easy to access, and the setup process is a really simple. Plus, it supports a variety of themes.

Some standout features include **Quick Terminal** and the ability to use **Cmd + Triple-click** for selection—simple yet powerful.

So, I’ve made the switch. My terminal is now Ghostty.
