Stay connected with my blog updates by subscribing to [my RSS feed](https://tduyng.github.io/atom.xml).

**RSS** (Really Simple Syndication) is a convenient way to receive the latest content from your favorite websites directly to your reader app.

**To get started, follow these simple steps:**

- Choose a reader app: You need an RSS reader app to subscribe to feeds. You can find a great list of hosted RSS readers and apps [here](https://aboutfeeds.com/) or [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/). For MacOS, I personally recommend [NetNewsWire](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire) â€“ it's open-source and completely free.

- Subscribe to my feed: Once you have your reader app installed, add [my blog's RSS link](https://tduyng.github.io/atom.xml) to your feed sources.

That's it! You'll now receive all my latest posts and updates directly in your reader.

Check out how the [NetNewsWire app](https://netnewswire.com/screenshots.htm) looks like:
