You might know me online as "tduyng" or "tienduy-nguyen". Feel free to call me "Duy", pronounced like "Zwee" in Vietnamese. That's why I like to use "Z" in my development accounts. I'm not big on social media, but I love working on tech projects!

## Current role
I'm currently a Backend Engineer at [Ekino France](https://www.ekino.fr) where I specialise in NodeJs/Typescript and AWS for [CANAL+ projects](https://www.canalplus.com/) since 2021.

## Past experience
Before my current role, I worked as a BIM Engineer (Building Information Modeling Engineer) at [VINCI Group](https://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/fr/index.htm) in France. Alongside my BIM responsibilities, I developed numerous plugins in C# and VBA to automate tasks for my company.
