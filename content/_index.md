Welcome! I'm **Duy NG**, a Backend Engineer based in France.

I enjoy building fast, reliable systems with `TypeScript`, `Go`, and `Rust`. My philosophy: **terminal-first, keyboard-centric**. I work with `Neovim`, `Nix`, and tools that keep me in the terminal where I'm most productive.

I write about what I learn and build from backend architecture to developer workflows. You'll find deeper stories in my [blog](/blog) and quick discoveries in my [notes](/notes).
