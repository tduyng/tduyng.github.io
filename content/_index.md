Welcome! I'm **Duy NG**, a Backend Engineer based in France.

I love building fast, reliable systems. My workflow is simple: stay in the terminal, keep my hands on the keyboard, and focus on what matters.

I write about what I learn and build. You'll find deeper stories in my [blog](/blog) and quick discoveries in my [notes](/notes).
