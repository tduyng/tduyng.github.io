You might know me online as "tduyng" or "tienduy-nguyen". Feel free to call me "Duy", pronounced like "Zwee" in Vietnamese. That's why I like to use "Z" in my development accounts. I'm not big on social media, but I love working on tech projects!

## Current Role
I'm currently a Backend Engineer at [Ekino France](https://www.ekino.fr) where I specialize in NodeJs/Typescript and AWS since 2021.

## Past Experience
Before my current role, I worked as a BIM engineer (Building Information Modeling engineer) at [VINCI Group](https://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/fr/index.htm) in France. Alongside my BIM responsibilities, I developed numerous plugins in C# and VBA to automate tasks for my company.

I'm working on a few projects:

- coming soon

---
I'm a nice person (I think?) and  easy to work with.
Here's a bunch of bubbles with technical keywords in them. This is not at all an exhaustive list of everything I've used / done in a professional context:

- Javascript/Typescript
- NodeJS/Deno/Bun
- Rust
- Scripting
- AWS
- CI/CD
- SQL/NoSQL
- Docker/Kubenetes/ArgoCD/DevOps
- Technical Writing
- React/Svelte/HTML/CSS
- C#/Python/Ruby/VBA



<!-- Open Source - GitHub
I currently have a few interesting irons in the Open Source fire:

piccolo - A weird stackless Lua interpreter. Nearly 100% safe Rust,[1] surprisingly capable, stackless,[2] and did I mention weird?[3]

gc-arena - A safe (to use) Rust garbage collector. The collection part is not new, it's boring and respectable.[4] Uses generative typing[5] to achieve zero-cost Gc<T> pointers isolated to a single "arena". Used by Ruffle so it can't be that terrible!

webrtc-unreliable - I hacked "webtransport" into browsers before there was webtransport.[6]

turbulence - A networking library for games, takes an unreliable, unordered stream of datagrams and multiplexes it into many independent streams with optional reliability and ordering.

hashlink - What happens when a mommy[7] HashMap and a daddy[8] LinkedList love each other very much. Inhereted from Gankra, who inherited it from the pre-1.0 Rust stdlib. last time I checked it was in the dependency tree of Firefox so I should probably pay attention to it.

Hire Me
I'm currently open for the right sort of work! I'm comfortable in a ton of languages and environments, and despite being a huge fan of Rust (and doing most of my open source work currently in Rust, and being a RustConf keynote speaker), I promise I'm not a a language zealot or anything.[9] It matters much more to me what the work is than what language I might be working in.[10]

I'm a generalist who's kinda bad at selling herself. I've worked in games, scientific simulation, networking, print media... I've done app development, game development, backend web development, bad frontend web development... I've been the build engineer, the C++ expert, the infrastructure person, the networking expert... and I'm always wearing several of these hats at the same time. I like working in small teams / small companies / startups that need somebody that doesn't actually mind having five jobs at once.

I'm a good fit when you have tasks that cut across disciplines. I'm a good fit when you just need somebody to make something work and the answer isn't going to be found on Stack Overflow. I was (maybe?) the first person to get the Rust compiler and stdlib working on the PS4, Switch, and XBox One, and I did it in about two weeks. I was the lead programmer on a video game that sold 4 million copies. I know how compilers and language runtimes work, I know how to use strace, I can do serviceable pixel art, I know how a rendering pipeline works, I can write an okay 3d physics engine, I know how to read a scientific paper, I can do public speaking. I like to think that I know what I'm good at, I know what I'm not so good at, and I know what I can be okay at if you give me a couple of weeks.

I'm a nice person and (I think?) easy to work with, and I try not to take technical things too seriously or have a big head about anything. I'm open to remote work or hybrid / on-site if you're in the Denver / Boulder area, so if you like me or like my writing, let's talk!

Here's a bunch of bubbles with technical keywords in them. This is not at all an exhaustive list of everything I've used / done in a professional context, I can provide a more detailed resume upon request. -->
