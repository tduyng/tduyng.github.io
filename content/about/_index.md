**Hey there! I'm Duy NG.**

You might know me online as "tduyng" or "tienduy-nguyen". Feel free to call me "Duy", pronounced like "Zwee" in Vietnamese. While I'm not big on social media, I have a deep passion for tech projects and contributing to open-source communities.

## Current role
I'm currently a Backend Engineer at [Ekino](https://www.ekino.fr) in France, specializing in NodeJs/Typescript and AWS for [CANAL+ projects](https://www.canalplus.com/) since 2021.

## Past experiences
Before diving into backend engineering, I worked as a BIM Engineer (Building Information Modeling Engineer) at [VINCI Group](https://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/fr/index.htm) in France. Alongside my BIM responsibilities, I developed numerous plugins in C#, [Dynamo](https://dynamobim.org/) and VBA (Excel) to automate tasks for my company.

## Open-sources contributions
