# Hello, I'm Duy!

I'm a Software Engineer in France. You'll find me online as "tduyng", where I code, learn, and occasionally contribute to open source.

My name is pronounced "Zwee" (yes, really).

## Work

At [ekino](https://www.ekino.fr), I build and maintain backend projects using Node.js, TypeScript, Docker, Kubernetes and AWS. Since 2021, I've been working on making applications that can handle heavy workloads reliably.

Before backend development, I worked as a BIM Engineer (Building Information Modeling) at [VINCI Group](https://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/fr/index.htm), France's leading construction company. I built software, plugins and scripting tools with C#, [Dynamo](https://dynamobim.org/), and Excel/VBA that helped teams work faster and better.

## Tech stack

Here's what I work with:

- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, C#, Python, Ruby, VBA
- **Frameworks**: Node.js/Deno/Bun/Nest.js, React/HTML/CSS
- **DevOps**: AWS, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, ArgoCD
- **Databases**: SQL/NoSQL (Postgresql, MySql, MongoDB, Redis, Elastic search)
- **Version control**: Git/GitLab/GitHub
- **Scripting & automation**: Bash scripts, makefile, justfile, JS scripting

## Writing

Writing helps me think and learn. I document what I discover, the problems I solve, and the tools I explore. It's not about being prescriptive, it's about sharing the journey.

I keep two types of content here:

- [Blog posts](/blog) for deeper technical stories and tutorials
- [Quick notes](/notes) for things I want to remember and share

You'll also find some of my writing on [tduyng.medium.com](https://tduyng.medium.com).

I'm always open to feedback, corrections, or discussions. Reach me at [contact@tduyng.com](mailto:contact@tduyng.com).

## This site

This site is built with [gozzi](https://github.com/tduyng/gozzi), a static site generator I created in Go.

**Why build my own?** I wanted something simple that I could fully understand and customize. Static site generators like Hugo and Zola are excellent, but building `gozzi` helped me learn how they work under the hood.

**Why I love it:**

- Write in Markdown (my favorite format for technical content)
- No dealing with HTML/CSS for every page
- Fast builds and easy to scale
- Complete control over the build process
- Actually fun to write with

The site is intentionally minimal. Just content and a focus on what matters, sharing ideas and learning together.
