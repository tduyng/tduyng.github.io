## The short version

- **No personal data collected** – I don't store IP addresses or track you across sessions
- **No cookies** – This site doesn't use cookies
- **Comments via GitHub** – Handled by [giscus](https://giscus.app/), stored on GitHub
- **Basic analytics** – I use self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is/) to see page views and referrers (GDPR compliant, no personal data)

That's it. Simple and privacy-friendly.

## What analytics I collect

To improve the site, I track these non-personal metrics:

- Which pages you visit
- Where you came from (referrer)
- Your browser and device type
- Your country (based on IP, not stored)

I **don't** track:
- Individual users across sessions
- How long you stay
- Where you go after leaving

## Comments
