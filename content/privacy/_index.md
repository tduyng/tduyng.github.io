## Analytics

I use self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is/) to understand how people use this site. It's privacy-friendly (GDPR compliant, no cookies) and tracks only these basics:

- Pages you visit
- Where you came from
- Browser and device type
- Country (from IP, not stored)

**What I don't track:**
- Individual users across visits
- Time spent on pages
- Where you go after leaving

No personal data. No IP addresses stored. No tracking cookies.
