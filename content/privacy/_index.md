## The short version

I don't collect personal data. No IP addresses, no tracking across sessions, no cookies.

Comments are handled by [giscus](https://giscus.app/) via GitHub. I use self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is/) for basic analytics (page views, referrers) - fully GDPR compliant.

That's it.

## What analytics I collect

To improve the site, I track these non-personal metrics:

- Which pages you visit
- Where you came from (referrer)
- Your browser and device type
- Your country (based on IP, not stored)

I **don't** track:
- Individual users across sessions
- How long you stay
- Where you go after leaving

## Comments

Comments use [giscus](https://giscus.app/) powered by GitHub Discussions. GitHub handles the data per their [privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

You can view all comments in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/tduyng/tduyng.github.io/discussions/categories/general).
