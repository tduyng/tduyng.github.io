## What analytics I collect

I don't collect personal data. No IP addresses, no tracking across sessions, no cookies.

To improve the site, I use self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is/) for basic analytics (page views, referrers) - fully GDPR compliant, That track these non-personal metrics:

- Which pages you visit
- Where you came from (referrer)
- Your browser and device type
- Your country (based on IP, not stored)

I **don't** track:

- Individual users across sessions
- How long you stay
- Where you go after leaving
