This privacy policy outlines how we collect and process your data on this website.

## What data do we collect?

### General browsing {#what-general}

While browsing the site, no personal information is collected. IP addresses are not stored in any way in the server logs.

### Comments {#what-comments}

We do not collect any data when you send a comment or reaction, but GitHub does in order to provide the service.

### Analytics {#what-analytics}

For website improvement, the following non-personal data is collected:

- **Referrer**: the source that led you to this site.
- **Requested URL**: the specific page you visited.
- **User-Agent**: identifies the browser and operating system you use (e.g. "Safari 17.0, Mac OS X").
- **Country name**: the country you are visiting from, determined by your IP address.
- **Screen type**: the type of your device.
- **Time**: when you accessed the site.
- **Browsing session**: a temporary identification code generated from your IP address, browser information, and a random number. This is used to recognise a browsing session for 8 hours. After that time, the code is deleted from memory and is not stored anywhere.

I do not track unique visitors across sessions, and I do not track how long you stay on the site or where you go after you leave.
