Hi there!

Deno, created by Ryan Dahl, the original mind behind Node.js, is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It addresses various limitations and issues found in Node.js.

Since its initial stable release with version 1.0, Deno has continued to evolve, with the latest version currently at 1.44. Are you ever curious about Deno's suitability for production projects today? Wondering if developers are actively using it in production?

You can read my full article for a detailed analysis here: [Should You Switch to Deno?](https://medium.com/ekino-france/should-you-switch-to-deno-c0e7c9ca6e41).

I hope this helps you make an informed decision. Happy coding!
