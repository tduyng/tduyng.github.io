## What is **Docker compose**?

If you read this article, I think you maybe already understand what is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker). 

Docker is a tool which helps to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker provides developers and operators with a friendly interface to build, ship, and run containers on any environment.


With the docker-cli, we can run and execute the Docker container via [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#:~:text=A%20Dockerfile%20is%20a%20text,can%20use%20in%20a%20Dockerfile%20.). But with Dockerfile, we can work only with a container, but in the project, we normally work with multiple containers. In that case, we need to use **Docker compose**.


**Docker Compose** define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment. It get an app running in one command by just running `docker-compose up`.


**Docker compose** uses the `Dockerfile` if one add the build command to your project’s `docker-compose.yml`. Your Docker workflow should be to build a suitable `Dockerfile` for each image you wish to create, then use compose to assemble the images using the build command.

We will create a demo: simple app nodejs using Redis. You will see the problem with only **Dockerfile** and why use **Docker compose**.

## Project demo

### Installation

Make sure you have docker & docker-compose installed in your machine:
- [How to install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [How to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Create Docker Images without Docker compose
- Create project folder
  ```bash
  $ mkdir node-redis-demo
  $ cd node-redis-demo
  ```
- Create `package.json` file

  In this file, we will declare the dependencies we use for our application. This step is similar as you create the Nodejs application (without **npm install** or **yarn add** dependencies).

  We consider our computer don't have **npm** or **yarn** installed. We just use Docker to create the develop environment.


  ```bash
  $ touch package.json # or yarn init -y
  ```
  Paste the following code:

  ```javascript
  //package.json
    {
    "name": "node-redis-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "license": "MIT",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "redis": "*", //We don't care about the version of dependencies
      "express": "*", //Docker will fetch the latest version of them
    }
  }
  ```
- Create `index.js` file to config `express` and run server
  ```javascript
  //index.js
  const express = require('express');
  const redis = require('redis');
  const app = express();

  const client = redis.createClient();
  client.on('error', function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  });
  client.set('visits', 0);

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    client.get('visits', (err, visits) => {
      res.send('Number of visits is ' + visits);
      client.set('visits', parseInt(visits) + 1);
    });
  });

  const port = 8080;
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('App Redis is running on port 8080');
  });

  const 
  ```
- Create **Dockerfile**
  ```yml
  # Dockerfile
  FROM node:12.18-alpine #Version nodejs we want to use

  WORKDIR /app #Define the work directory of project in Docker container

  COPY package*.json ./ #Make sure always copy package.json and package-lock.json to build folder
  # Copy package.json to avoid reinstall all the dependencies for each build

  RUN yarn install #Run install and update dependencies from package.json

  COPY . . #Copy all other files to the build folder

  EXPOSE 8080 #Optional: Port running on Docker container
  CMD ["node", "index.js"] #Command line to run project

  ```
  You can also check an article on my blog for more information of Dockerfile: [Create simple project Nodejs with Docker](https://tduyng.github.io/blog/create-simple-project-nodejs-with-docker)
- Create `.dockerignore`
  
  ```yml
  node_modules
  npm-debug.log
  yarn-debug.log
  ```
- Build Docker Image
  OK, everything is done. Now, we will build this image:
  ```bash
  $ docker build -t node-redis-app .
  ```
  Don't forget the point **.** in the end.



  You can check all images available in your computer:
  ```bash
  $ docker images
  ```
- Run Docker container from Docker image
  We have already an Docker image node-redis-app. The thing to do now is run container from this image to start project.

  ```bash
  $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -it node-redis-app
  ```
  **-p 8080:8080** flag: declare port using (port on Docker container and port on your machine)
  **-it** flag: allow access inside the terminal of Docker container
  **node-redis-app**: name image of your app
  
- Problem
  When you run with the command above, you will see an error failed connection with Redis-server:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -it node-redis-app

  App Redis is running on port 8080
  Error: Redis connection to 127.0.0.1:6379 failed - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
      at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1141:16) {
    errno: 'ECONNREFUSED',
    code: 'ECONNREFUSED',
    syscall: 'connect',
    address: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 6379
  }

  ```

  **What is the problem ?**
  The problem is: You want to run 2 containers in same times.
  ==> **redis-server** && **nodejs**
  But when you run your Dockerfile, you run only Nodejs app container, not to redis container.
  You can also create other redis-server container from [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) image

  There are no any link between 2 this containers. Your Nodejs application can't connect to **redis-server**(from **redis** Docker image).

  **How to resolve this error?**
  The answer is **Docker compose**. In this case, we need to use Docker compose to run and connect multiple Docker container.

### Create Docker image using Docker compose

- To make sure the project above running, we need simply create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
It is a config file for docker-compose. It allows us to define the services (container) using in our app.

  ```bash
  $ touch docker-compose.yml
  ```

- Add the following code:

  ```yml
  version: '3.8' #version of docker-compose
  services: # declare containers used
    redis-server: #image of redis
      image: 'redis'
    node-app: #images of your node app (using Dockerfile, package.json ...)
      restart: always #If this container stops for any reason, always attempt to restart it
      build: .
      ports:
        - '8080:8080'

  ```
  Check [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) for more details about configuration.


- Update redis services to `index.js` file
  
  ```javascript
  // index.js
  const express = require('express');
  const redis = require('redis');
  const app = express();
  const process = require('process');

  const client = redis.createClient({
    host: 'redis-server',
    port: '6379',
  });
  client.on('error', function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  });
  client.set('visits', 0);

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    process.exit(0);
    client.get('visits', (err, visits) => {
      res.send('Number of visits is ' + visits);
      client.set('visits', parseInt(visits) + 1);
    });
  });

  const port = 8080;
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('App Redis is running on port 8080');
  });

  ```
- Build and run your app with docker-compose
  
  In the root project:
  - Build images:
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose build
    ```
    When you use docker-compose to build the image, the image name is always going to be **<project>_<service>**, where **<service>** in this example is **node-redis-app_node-app**. 
  - Run containers with docker-compose
  ```bash
  $ docker-compose up # all services declared in docker-compose.yml will be started
  $ docker-compose up -d #detach mode
  ```
  - Stop containers with docker-compose
  ```bash
  $ docker-compose down # Stop all containers declared in docker-compose.yml file
  ```

That's it. Test the code on your machine and check it in then [localhost8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the result.
## Resume

Docker compose: 
- Separate CLI that gets installed along with Docker
- Used to startup multiple Docker containers at the same time
- Automate some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to `docker run`
- **Docker compose** will start and connect all the containers Docker that you declare in the `docker-compose.yml` file. We will use it usually when we work with Docker.
