# CLI tools I love using

I’m a huge fan of Rust, and it’s no surprise that many of the tools I rely on in the terminal are written in rust.

Here’s a quick rundown of my favorites:

- `Fzf`: Fuzzy finder that makes searching files or commands a breeze.
- `Eza`: A modern, colorful alternative to `ls` that adds more functionality.
- `Zoxide`: A smarter `cd` command that remembers your most-used directories.
- `Fish shell`: A user-friendly shell with auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting.
- `Starship prompt`: Fast, customizable prompt with support for all major shells.
- `Ripgrep`: Lightning-fast search tool, a must-have for large codebases.
- `Sd`: Simpler, more intuitive replacement for `sed`.
- `Fd`: Faster, friendlier alternative to `find` with colorful output.
- `Jq`: Power tool for processing JSON data in the terminal.
- `Lazygit`: Terminal-based Git interface, perfect for lazy devs.
- `Lazydocker`: Easy-to-use terminal tool for managing Docker containers.
- `Bat`: Better `cat` with syntax highlighting and line numbers.
- `Git-delta`: Enhanced git diff tool with better formatting.
- `Fnm`: Fast, Rust-based Node.js version manager.

**UPDATED LIST:**

- `Neovim`: + Lazyvim
- `Stow`: Manages dotfiles.
- `Ghostty`: Terminal emulator.
- `Aerospace`: Window manager.
- `Hyperfine`: Benchmarking tool.
