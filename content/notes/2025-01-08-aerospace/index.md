# Tiling window management on macOS with `aerospace`

In the past, I was a `rectangle` user. I used it to move windows into corners or split the screen, basic functionality. Honestly, it never felt transformative. It was fine, but quite basic. I only used it during screen-sharing sessions on Teams calls. I always wanted something more controllable and better organized, with groupings of applications.

Recently, I explored `raycast`, and at first, it seemed like the solution I had been looking for. It offered intuitive window organization, powerful workspace controls, and a lot of cool features.  
But then I discovered that many of the features I wanted required the Pro version. So I knew I had to look elsewhere.

That’s when I came across [aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/aerospace), thanks to all the people sharing it on YouTube. And wow! This is the tool I was looking for! (powerful, free, open-source, workspace management simple, entirely keyboard shortcuts)

Using aerospace has completely transformed my workflow. I now have workspaces neatly organized by task coding (C), terminal (T), browser (B), music (M)... and switching between them is really simple. I can even set apps to open in specific workspaces by default. So cool! Everything feels smoother, faster, and more focused.

For me, there’s only one drawback: aerospace doesn’t natively support the AZERTY keyboard layout, it might a bit inconvenient. However, I can map the QWERTY shortcuts on same location with AZERTY layout and that solution is ok for me.
