My personal blog site generated with [gozzi](https://github.com/tduyng/gozzi), a lightweight Go-based static site generator.

This repository contains only the source (`markdown`, `templates`, `config`) and the generated `public/` output. It demonstrates how to structure content, templates, and configuration when using `gozzi`.
