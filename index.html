          <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
          <p>Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for
            his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply system.</p>
          <p>Tesla started working in the telephony and electrical fields before emigrating to the United States in 1884
            to work for Thomas Edison. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up
            laboratories/companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and
            transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla as a consultant to help develop an
            alternating current system. Tesla is also known for his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
            New
            York and Colorado Springs which included patented devices and theoretical work used in the invention of
            radio
            communication, for his X-ray experiments, and for his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless
            transmission in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.</p>

          <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
          <p>Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor,
            anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other
            figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the
            Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination". He is widely
            considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person
            ever
            to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without
            precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco
            Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially
            logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>

          <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
          <p>German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of
            modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E =
            mc2
            (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
            effect".
            The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>
          <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to
            reconcile
            the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of
            his
            special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended
            to
            gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the
            general theory of relativity.</p>

            <h1>Isaac Newton</h1>
            <p>English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of
              all
              time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
              Mathematica
              ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for most
              of
              classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried
              Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus.</p>
            <p>Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists'
              view
              of the physical universe for the next three centuries. It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on
              the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. By deriving Kepler's
              laws
              of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the
              validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos.</p>
