<p class="dropCap">Custom domains are great! They allow us to connect to our users in a much nicer way. If you are hosting your project with GitHub, I am sure that you aren’t too fond of the username.github.io/repository URL that they give you.</p>

<p>So you want to know how to use a custom Apex domain with your GitHub hosted project. Luckily this is a fairly simple task. Before we get started, you are obviously going to need a domain name and your repository on GitHub. There are a few main steps that we need to complete &mdash; let’s get it done.</p>

<p class="centeredDesc"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmxxA32yrFU&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" class="lb-js" data-type="embed" data-host="youtube" data-path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmxxA32yrFU">For the lazy people who don't want to read.</a></p>

<h4>Step 01.</h4>
<ol class="noTopPad">
  <li>Go to your repository on GitHub and click on the “Settings” tab located under your repository’s name.</li>
  <li>Scroll till you see “Custom domain”, then enter your domain name that you wish to use and hit “Save”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hey look at that, we are almost done. Just in case you are curious or you need to know if your custom domain is supported at GitHub, you can read, “<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-supported-custom-domains/" target="_blank">About supported custom domains</a>”.</p>

<h4>Step 02.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Go to your DNS settings that your domain registrar gives you and get ready to create just a couple records.</li>
  <li>Create an “A” record that points to these two IP addresses (these IP addresses point to GitHub).
    <ul>
      <li>192.30.252.153</li>
      <li>192.30.252.154</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now you need to create a “CNAME” record. Set the name to “www” and tell it to point to “username.github.io”, using your GitHub username. If you don’t have a normal user account, read <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/custom-domain-redirects-for-github-pages-sites/" target="_blank">this</a> and make the necessary changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it, you’re done! I bet you weren’t expecting it to be that easy. If your custom domain is not working yet, it could take a few minutes, but go ahead and add a file named “CNAME” to the root of your repository and add these two lines replacing “yourdomain” with your actual domain name.</p>

<pre class="highlightCode">
yourdomain.com
www.yourdomain.com
</pre>

<p>If all else fails and it is still not working, read “<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/" target="_blank">Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site</a>“ and see if GitHub can help you figure it out in their spider web of custom domain setup instructions.</p>
